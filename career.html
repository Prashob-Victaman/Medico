approximately, make decisions, learn to trust themselves and one another, and build
confidence. For Group Therapy, the residents meet in two groups with their therapists.
This is a time when each one of them can work out various issues by setting goals that
are behaviour oriented, i.e., goals that are observable, realistic and achievable. One way
in which residents are visually stimulated is by using charts with their names, on which
they move step by step, depending on their efforts to reach the goal. This is also the time
for bringing up personal issues. The group is used for support and, if necessary, to
caringly confront any behaviour that is inappropriate or irresponsible. It is also a time
when, once again, residents appreciate each other’s positive behaviour and traits.The family therapy meetings are held to involve the family in the treatment programme
with an idea to prepare the residents for their future rehabilitation, re-socialization and
re-settlement. They are required to be conducted systematically and scientifically, at
